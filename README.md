# Collabo styles-library

Collabo styles-library contains reusable styles (css, less and sass) grouped with classes. Styles are useable on any element or section of the webpage. Built with javascript nodejs, webpack, babel, less and sass css-preprocessors. Contribute to the styles-library which is meant to replace [less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library). Still in development. We want the repo/project to contain SCSS and LESS and also be production suitable. You could also help with [documentation](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/styles-library/).
