# Collabo styles-library

Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. Collabo styles-library is a replacement for the [less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library). The styles-library uses css, sass and less preprocessors, and will contain more than just display styles. Work has started on making the code suitable for production. You can help with code and the [styles-library documentation](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/styles-library/) too. 

Collabo styles-library is made up of reusable css style blocks, useable on any element or section of the webpage. Built with javascript, nodejs, webpack, babel, less and sass css-preprocessors. To contribute, see [contribution guidelines](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/doc/collabo-guidelines/contributing) for how to work with code-collabo repos generally.
